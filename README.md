# Groovy Null Comparison Bug

This example demonstrates a common issue in Groovy related to comparing strings with null using the == operator.  Groovy's dynamic typing can lead to unexpected results in these scenarios.

The `bug.groovy` file contains the buggy code.  `bugSolution.groovy` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:**
The `==` operator in Groovy doesn't strictly enforce type checking.  This means that `null == "" ` evaluates to `false` which might be unexpected compared to languages with stricter type systems.  The intended logic likely needs to check for both null and empty strings explicitly.
